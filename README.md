## Overview

Inji Certify enables issuers to generate, sign and issue a verifiable credentials. It follows the standard of OpenID4VCI (Open ID For VC Issuance) draft 13. It also issues VC complaints with W3C Verifiable Credentials (1.1 & 2.0). Issuers can configure credential schemas for different certificate types, generating credentials in different VC formats such JSON-LD, SD-JWT etc.

In particular, certify focuses on the issuer’s role in and provides the following features from OpenID4VC (draft 13):

To know more about features available in certify please refer to [this documentation](https://docs.inji.io/inji-certify/overview/features).

## Architecture

Certify features a modular architecture that supports both direct issuance and proxying of VCs from external sources. It interacts with external digital wallets via APIs.

For a detailed view of Inji Certify’s architecture and components, check this [link](https://docs.inji.io/inji-certify/technical-overview/components).

## Plugin Support

Inji Certify provides a **plugin-based architecture** that enables modular, extensible, and customizable credential issuance workflows.

### Types of Plugins

* **VC Issuance Plugins**
  Handle the retrieval and alignment of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) as per standards, and manage the issuance process.
* **Data Provider Plugins**
  Fetch raw data from various sources, generate the credential, sign it, and issue it.
    * Currently supported integrations: PostgresSQL and CSV files.

### How to Use Plugins

* **[Overview: Choosing the Right Plugin](./docs/VCIssuance-vs-DataProvider.md)** – Learn the differences between the two plugin types and how to decide which suits your issuer requirements.
* **[Postgres Data Provider Plugin](https://github.com/mosip/digital-credential-plugins/tree/master/postgres-dataprovider-plugin)** – Example walkthrough using the **Land Registry use case**. The same steps can be adapted for other use cases.
* **[Mock CSV Data Provider Plugin](https://github.com/mosip/digital-credential-plugins/tree/master/mock-certify-plugin#mockcsvdataproviderplugin)** – Guide for trying out the CSV-based plugin.
* **[VC Issuance Plugin](https://github.com/mosip/digital-credential-plugins/tree/master/mock-certify-plugin#mockvcissuanceplugin)** - Guide for trying VC issuance plugin.

### Advanced: Creating Custom Plugins

For advanced users, you can develop your own plugins by implementing the `DataProviderPlugin` interface:

```java
public interface DataProviderPlugin {
    // Implement your custom logic here
}
```

* **Reference Implementation:** [Postgres Data Provider Plugin](https://github.com/mosip/digital-credential-plugins/tree/master/postgres-dataprovider-plugin)
* Once a custom plugin has been developed refer to this [document](https://github.com/mosip/inji-certify/blob/master/docs/Custom-Plugin-K8s.md) to deploy the plugin.

## Deployment

Inji Certify supporting two mode of deployment to cater different users with different purpose:

1.  **Local Development Setup**

    * Intended for experimentation and user experience. Local Setup can be carried out in two ways:
        * **Local Setup with Docker Compose**
            * Recommended for users who want to experience the product from a technical/backend perspective.
            * Refer to [this guide](./docker-compose/docker-compose-injistack/README.md) to try this mode of setup.
        * **Local Setup without Docker Compose**
            * Recommended for developers or community contributors who want to perform debugging or gain a deeper understanding of the Inji Certify codebase.
            * Refer to [this guide](./docs/Local-Development.md) to try this mode of setup.
    * This is for developers, community members, and country representatives to explore the application, demonstrate its usage to external stakeholders, or conduct proof-of-concepts (POCs).

2.  **Deployment with Kubernetes cluster**

    * Designed for production environments.
    * Enables issuers to host and utilize the product at scale.
    * Click [here](https://docs.inji.io/readme/setup/deploy#deploying-inji-certify) to learn more about this mode of deployment.

If you are creating your own custom plugin, you can refer to [this link](https://github.com/mosip/inji-certify/blob/master/docs/Custom-Plugin-K8s.md) to know steps to deploy custom plugins using kubernetes.

## Configurations

In this section, you will refer to the key configurations which required to be enabled for specific feature or to run the whole applications.

### Auth Service Integration (e.g., Keycloak)

For authentication flows (e.g., with eSignet or other OIDC providers who are compliant with oAuth 2.0), below configuration to be modified as part of integration:

```properties
mosip.certify.authorization.url= https://keycloak-26.collab.mosip.net/auth/realms/inji
mosip.certify.authn.issuer-uri=${mosip.certify.authorization.url} 
mosip.certify.authn.jwk-set-uri=${mosip.certify.authorization.url}/protocol/openid-connect/certs
mosip.certify.identifier=${mosip.certify.domain.url}
mosip.certify.domain.url=https://injicertify-mock.collab.mosip.net
```

**Note** : OIDC scopes relevant to VC issuance.

To know more about this configuration please refer to [this link](https://docs.inji.io/inji-certify/build-and-deploy/local-setup#configuring-certify-with-keycloak-authorization-server).


### Enable VC Issuance with mock mDoc/mDL format

To enable certify to issue VC with mDoc/mDL (mock is supported currently) few properties needed to be updated. Refer [here](https://github.com/mosip/digital-credential-plugins/tree/master/mock-certify-plugin#mdocmockvcissuanceplugin) to know about the properties.

## Databases

Refer to [SQL scripts](./db_scripts/README.md) and go through its README.

## Upgrades

### Upgrade from 0.11.0 to 0.12.0

Please refer to step-by-step [migration guide](./docs/Migration-Guide-0.11.0-to-0.12.0.md) for upgrade from 0.11.0 to 0.12.0.

## Upcoming Features

* Additional formats: mDoc/mDL, Signed JWT
* Credential Revocation APIs & discovery mechanisms (SD-JWT, mDoc/mDL)
* Presentation during Issuance
* Pre authorised code & credential offer

**Note** : Currently, mDoc/mDL support is available only in mock mode. A full implementation will be provided in a future release.
