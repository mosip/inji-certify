# Migration Guide: Inji Certify 0.11.0 â†’ 0.12.0

This guide details the steps required to manually migrate your Inji Certify deployment from version **0.11.0** to **0.12.0**.

---

## 1. Database Upgrade

1. **Backup your database** before proceeding with any upgrade steps.
2. Navigate to the `db_upgrade_script` directory:
   ```sh
   cd db_upgrade_script
   ```
3. Review and configure the properties file as per your environment. Ensure all required values are set. Below is a sample `upgrade.properties` configuration:

   ```properties
   ACTION=upgrade
   MOSIP_DB_NAME=inji_certify
   DB_SERVERIP=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=5432
   SU_USER=postgres
   SU_USER_PWD=admin
   DEFAULT_DB_NAME=inji_certify
   CURRENT_VERSION=0.11.0
   UPGRADE_VERSION=0.12.0
   ```
   > **Note:** Ensure the `upgrade.properties` file is present in the same directory as the script, or provide the full path when running the script.

4. Run the upgrade shell script, passing the properties file as an argument:
   ```sh
   ./upgrade.sh upgrade.properties
   ```
   - This script will:
     - Apply database schema and data changes required for 0.12.0
   - Follow on-screen prompts and warnings.
5. On successful completion, the script will log the upgrade status and any errors encountered.

6. To rollback the upgrade, update the `ACTION` property in your `upgrade.properties` file to `rollback` and re-run the script with the properties file as an argument:
   ```properties
   ACTION=rollback
   MOSIP_DB_NAME=inji_certify
   DB_SERVERIP=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=5432
   SU_USER=postgres
   SU_USER_PWD=admin
   DEFAULT_DB_NAME=inji_certify
   CURRENT_VERSION=0.11.0
   UPGRADE_VERSION=0.12.0
   ```
   Then execute:
   ```sh
   ./upgrade.sh upgrade.properties
   ```
   - This will attempt to revert the database changes applied during the upgrade.

7. On successful completion, the script will log the rollback status and any errors encountered.

## 3. Post-Upgrade Steps

Critical steps to perform in credential configuration after the upgrade:
- Update the `scope`, `key_manager_app_id`, `key_manager_ref_id` and `did_url` in the migrated credential configuration(credential_config) database table via direct DB update or using the credential-configuration API. Refer to [API documentation](https://mosip.stoplight.io/docs/inji-certify) for more details on request and API details.
- Restart all Inji Certify services after the upgrade.
- Verify application logs for errors or warnings.
- Test all critical workflows to ensure successful migration.

## 4. Troubleshooting

- Check the logs displayed in the console for details on the upgrade process and errors.
- Recheck the upgrade properties file for any misconfigurations.
- Ensure that the database user has sufficient privileges to perform schema changes.
- If the upgrade fails, review logs and resolve issues before retrying.
